# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
Model C, because it gave complete and interesting answers.

Most similar in conciseness. Most different in creativity—Model C was the most original.


### Were you surprised by any of the results?
Yes, I didn’t expect one model to be both creative and accurate.

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
Tone and helpfulness. The answer should feel friendly and useful.
